<strong> The laboratory on cardiovascular imaging & dynamics </strong> of the department of cardiovascular sciences has traditionally focused on the development, validation and application of new imaging methodologies that can help in obtaining more insight in the (patho)physiology of the heart and – as such – contribute to a better diagnosis and therapy of the individual cardiac patient. Historically, ultrasound imaging of the heart has taken a central role in the research projects although other imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging and optical coherence tomography are part of the research program as well. Research has focused on ultrasound image formation (i.e. beam forming); image processing to automate biomarker extraction; and computer-aided-diagnostics (CAD) based on artificial intelligence methodologies. The research lab is embedded in the Medical Imaging Research Centre of the KU Leuven that is located in the core of the university hospital. Being located in the core of the clinical imaging modalities, access to imaging data and scanners is highly facilitated..
