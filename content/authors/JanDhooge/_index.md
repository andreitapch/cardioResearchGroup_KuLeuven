Jan D'hooge is the head of Cardiovascular Imaging and Dynamics at Ku Leuven. He received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in physics from the University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, in 1994 and 1999, respectively. He was a Post-Doctoral Researcher with the Medical Imaging Computing Laboratory, Electrical Engineering Department, University of Leuven, where he became acquainted with general problems in medical imaging, such as elastic registration, segmentation, shape analysis, and data acquisition problems related to other modalities (in particular, MRI). In 2006, he was appointed as an Associate Professor with the Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Medical Faculty, University of Leuven, where he is currently leading the Cardiovascular Imaging and Dynamics Research Unit. From 2009 to 2021, he was a part-time Visiting Researcher with the Norwegian Institute of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway. Since 2020, he has been an Honorary Affiliate of the Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London. He has authored or coauthored over 300 peer-reviewed papers, has contributed to 14 books, and has coedited two books. His current research interests include myocardial tissue characterization, deformation imaging, and cardiac pathophysiology. He was awarded a prestigious ERC consolidator grant; gave the 2018 Kalmanson Lecture of the American Society of Echocardiography, and won the 2019 IEEE Ultrasonics Carl Hellmuth Hertz Award. He was the Chair of the Ultrasound Conference of the SPIE Medical Imaging Symposium from 2008 to 2011, the Technical Vice-Chair of the IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium from 2008 to 2012, and the Technical Chair in 2014 and 2018. From 2019 to 2022, he was the Chair of the IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium Guidance Committee. In August 2021, he was appointed as the Vice-Rector on research policy of KU Leuven.
