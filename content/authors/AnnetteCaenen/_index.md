Annette Caenen received a M.S. degree in Civil Engineering from the Catholic University of Leuven in 2011 and a M.S. degree and Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Engineering from Ghent University in 2013 and 2018, respectively. She collaborated with the Physics for Medicine Institute in Paris and the Nightingale lab at Duke University during her PhD and is still a visiting researcher at Duke University. After her PhD, she worked for 1 year as a post-doctoral researcher at the Department of Biomedical Engineering of the Thorax Center (Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands). She currently works as FWO postdoctoral fellow at the IBiTech-bioMMeda lab of Ghent University (Ghent, Belgium), the Cardiovascular Imaging and Dynamics lab of Catholic University of Leuven (Leuven, Belgium) and the Department of Biomedical Engineering of the Thorax Center (Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands). Her research interests are shear wave elastography, biomechanics, finite element modeling and non-invasive material characterization; with a focus on cardiac applications.
